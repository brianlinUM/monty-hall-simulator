# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

In a game show, the host shows the player three doors. Behind one door is a
prize. The other two doors have no prizes. The player chooses a door.

Before the host opens the chosen door, he opens another door, which revealed no
prize.

Now, the player is given the chance to switch their choice to the other
unopened door or keep their first choice.

Is it better to switch or not switch?

This program simulates the game and finds the success rate for the player
switching and not switching doors.
